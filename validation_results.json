        "original_response": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into food (glucose) and oxygen. This process is fundamental for life on Earth as it provides the oxygen we breathe and is the base of the food chain.",
        "validation_result": "RETRY: answer differs from KB",
        "retry_response": "Photosynthesis is a biological process carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria, where they convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy. This process involves the absorption of light by chlorophyll, which leads to the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a type of sugar. The glucose is then used by the plants as a source of energy for growth and development. Oxygen is also produced as a byproduct of this process."

        "retry_response": "The capital of the ancient Atlantis is not known. The existence of Atlantis itself is a topic of debate among historians and archaeologists, as it is primarily known from the works of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. In his dialogues, he described Atlantis as a powerful and advanced kingdom that sank into the sea, but he did not provide specific details about its capital. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a factual answer to this question."

        "retry_response": "I'm sorry, but it's not possible to quantify the number of atoms in a human thought. Thoughts are not physical entities that can be measured in terms of atoms. They are a result of complex processes in the brain involving neurons, neurotransmitters, and electrical signals."

However, it's important to note that goldfish, or any other animals, do not have the cognitive capacity to understand complex scientific concepts such as quantum physics. They lack the necessary language comprehension, abstract thinking, and other cognitive abilities required to grasp such concepts."
